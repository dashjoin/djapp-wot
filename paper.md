# Generic Management of Web of Things based on JSON Schema

## Introduction 

The goal of the project is to showcase the benefits of an WoT enabled world: 

* The use of declarative specifications and reusable vocabularies enables any device to the managed seamlessly 
* Higher level tasks such as energy management or physical building security can be realized by combining generic capability specifications with AI 

## Team 

* Ege Korkan, Siemens 
* Andreas Eberhart, Dashjoin 

## Project Scope 

We will develop a WoT management system with the following features: 

* Connect to a WoT registry 
* Ability to browse / search all WoT devices 
* Ability to display all device data and call device APIs from user forms (dynamically rendered using JSON Schema) 
* Generic dashboards showing charts for common device status 
* OpenAI tool to allow users to interact with WoT devices using natural language (https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling)
