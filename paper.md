# AI Enabled WoT Management 

## Introduction 

Internet of Things (IoT) describes applying internet technology to devices in homes, factories, or smart cities. Obviously, this space offers tremendous potential for applications like energy management, predictive maintenance, and many more. With IoT being such a wide field, many different vendors are active in it. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard aims at overcoming the resulting interoperability challenge.

Several [WoT SDKs and tools](https://www.w3.org/WoT/developers/) are already available. We are specifically interested in applications that make use of WoTâ€™s generic nature. This means that rather than building a solution for one application area, we want the solution to be able to provide value on top of any WoT device. This concept was introduced by [Sciullo et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04617). It allows for any WoT device to be connected. The system displays the device properties and displays generic forms for conveniently invoking device actions. We build on their ideas and extend them, specifically by introducing security, semantic mappings, and the ability to leverage artificial intelligence to interact with arbitrary devices more easily.

## Wot Manager 

### Features 

WoT Manager offers the following features:

* **Discovery**: An important part of the WoT stack is the ability to [discover devices in a registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/). Given credentials and addresses, WoT Manager can connect to several registries.

* **Security**: Security is a cruicial aspect of IoT applications, specifically when actions such as opening doors or machine valves are concerned. The [WoT architecture document](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture10/#security) references well-known web security protocols which WoT Manager implements. 

* **Semantic Data Harmonization**: WoT makes heavy use of semantically annotated JSON-LD. An implicit benefit of this technology is the ability to "understand" data. This allows WoT manager to map syntactically different but semantically similar data from devices onto a common information model.

* **Visualization**: Once device data is aligned to a common model, it can be visualized accordingly. WoT Manager offers comprehensive charts fed from data received from heterogeneous devices.

* **Automation**: Besides visualization, a second benefit of a common information model is the ability to perform actions on different devices. Let's assume we would like to dim all lights to 50%, but the lights require this action to be triggered in a slightly different way. This can be achieved by mapping the semantic intention to the concrete call syntax, just like we do for incoming property data.

* **Natural Language Commands**: WoT Manager offers traditional forms for triggering device actions. To make things more usable, for instance in a smart home setting, WoT manager also provides natural language commands.

* **AI Planning**: Taking natural language commands a step further, WoT manager makes use of modern LLM's planning capabilities. A user can specify a goal in natural language. In turn, the system will figure out a way to accomplish this goal by invoking device actions.

### Architecture 

<img width="1449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88d14ca8-5557-4859-89ee-8617cdbc010b">

This figure describes the WoT manager architecture. We see the following components:

* The core application is built using the [Dashjoin Low Code platform](https://github.com/dashjoin/platform). The main motivation for this approach is the ability to quickly customize the generic management features with more specialized domain specific features. The platform consists of a horizontally scalable set of application servers and a shared configuration database that holds the application itself. Technically, this is a clone of the [WoT Manager GIT repository](https://github.com/dashjoin/djapp-wot).
* OpenID capable IDM: The IDM is used to authenticate users accessing the WoT Manager. Any OpenID capable IDM can be used. The platform maps claims associated to the user in the IDM to platform roles, which in turn grant the user access to devices and device actions.
* On top of the platform are the user interface as well as a REST API allowing 3rd party integrations.
* The TDs are stored in a PostgrSQL database. Note that the platform also supports RDF stores that would enable SPARQL queries over the device descriptions.
* The platform uses an LLM for the natural language and planning use cases. The LLM tool integration is done using the Python SDK available in Dashjoin Studio.
* The device connectivity uses RESTful APIs. We leverage APIs bridges to make other protocols like MQTT or COAP available via HTTP.
* The [RBAC](https://dashjoin.github.io/platform/latest/security/#access-control) and [credential manager](https://dashjoin.github.io/platform/latest/developer-reference/#credentials) are part of the platform.
* The mapping component sits between the platform and the device APIs

### Implementation 

#### Data Model

The first step is to represent the TDs in the PostgreSQL database. We are using the following schema for that:

<img width="860" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d2a478-e249-467e-ac27-2adc6773d008">

TODO: new screenshot to include fields for security

The TDs are stored in the table "thing" along with the child tables "property" and "action". The table registry is used to store the addresses of the registries. The next step is to load the data. The platform allows to express this extract-load-transform process using [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) with some extensions for accessing [REST services and databases](https://dashjoin.github.io/platform/latest/developer-reference/#dashjoin-expression-reference).

Loading all TDs from the registry can be done using the following code:

TODO: registry security

```
$all("wot", "registry").href.
  $curl("GET", $, {}, {})
```

The resulting list of TDs can then be mapped into the DB schema using mapping expression like the following one:

```
{
    {
      "thing": $id,
      "name": $k,
      "description": $v.description,
      // TODO: currently limited to HTTP
      // if only other protocols are offered, we should replace the href with that of the API gateway
      "href": $replace(forms[$."contentType" = "application/json"].href[$contains($, "http")], /\{.*\}/, ""),
      "vars": $vars ? $vars : uriVariables,
      "input": input,
      "output": output
    }
  }
```

This expression collects the action's JSON Schema from either the uriVariables or the "input" fields. Note that the platform offers a [streaming mode](https://dashjoin.github.io/platform/latest/developer-reference/#etl) to support importing large sets of TDs.

#### Security and Access Control

The platform can securely store [credentials](https://dashjoin.github.io/platform/latest/developer-reference/#credentials). The WoT specification allows defining security descriptors to the device or individual actions, properties, and events. The system currently supports security only on a thing level. This is achieved by defining credential sets and referencing them by name from the thing table. Any call performed from WoT Manager can be authenticated by reading the credential name and attaching this name to the curl HTTP header (the platform in turn looks up the secret from the credential store):

```
$credential = $read("wot", "thing", id).credential;
$curl(..., $credential ? {"Authorization": $credential} : {});
```

Since WoT Manager impersonates the users when communicating with the devices, we need to make sure that access control is enforced in the system. This is realized by associating device credentials with a system role. This means that only users in that role are allowed to use the credentials. The system also restricts user access to things they are not allowed to access by introducing a role column on the things table. When querying the things table, the system only returns those rows where the role column has a role the current user is in.

#### Semantic Data Harmonization

#### Generic Properties and Actions

TODO: mapping

The user interface for displaying device properties makes use of the platform's display widget. It is placed in a container that shows a widget for every device property. The widget simply displays the result of the HTTP request to the device WoT API. The device href is obtained from the foreach loop variable "value" which in turn is read from the database by looking up all properties of the current thing. Finally, the authorization header is obtained via the mechanism described in the security section:

```
(
  $c := $read("wot", "thing", value.thing).credentials;
  $curl("GET", value.href, {}, $c ? {"Authorization": $c} : {})
)
```

<img width="809" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2471909-b1b0-4f09-be0e-a1a07f777968">

The screenshot above shows a form that gathers data for performing an action. Wot Manager makes use of the JSON Schema descriptions found in the TDs. These can be fed directly into the platform's button widget, describing the form to display to the user. Note that the form tooltips and select values are taken directly from the JSON Schema property descriptions and type enums respectively. The form also automatically performs any input validation defined in the schema. In this example, some inputs are required to be present. The definition of the button widget is as follows:

```
// TODO: POST is hard coded
{
  "print": "($curl('POST', value.href & $call('template', form), form); $refresh();)",
  "schemaExpression": "value.vars ? {'properties': value.vars} : value.input",
  "title": "${value.name}",
  "widget": "button"
}
```

The field schemaExpression specifies a JSONata expression to compute the JSON Schema for the form. The field "print" specifies the action to perform when the button is pressed. We perform two commands. First, the action is performed. The call to the template subroutine helps to handle cases where the inputs are provided as URI variables. The call to refresh triggers the UI to redraw itself, getting potentially updated device values in the process, e.g. the water level being lower after a beverage was brewed.

#### Natural Language Commands

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/371fa9d1-1b07-4652-8e3e-236eff1cb050)

We're taking the form-based invocation a step further by introducing natural language commands. This feature takes advantage of the structured output mode of modern large language models. The following listing shows the configuration of the button widget. Rather than displaying a JSON Schema form corresponding to the action inputs, the widget shows a single text input that also allows voice inputs.

```
{
    "widget": "button",
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "Command": {
                "widget": "voice"
            }
        }
    },
    "print": see listing below,
    "text": "Brew"
}
```

The following code shows the call to the large language model (LLM). The [JSON mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) is activated by using the "response_format" of type "json_schema". This mode also allows specifying a target schema that should be populated by the LLM. We query this schema from the WoT database using the expression $all("wot", "action")[name="makeDrink"].vars. The LLM output is def into the parseJson function and stored in the variable x. After the LLM completes, we call the device action and pass the parsed JSON payload into the call.

```
(
$x := $curl("POST", "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
    "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You extract a coffee order into JSON data."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": form.Command
      }
    ],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "coffe_request_schema",
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": $all("wot", "action")[name="makeDrink"].vars,
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  }, {"Authorization": "openai"}).choices.message[0].content ~> $parseJson($);

$setVariable("request", $x);
$curl("POST", "http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/smart-coffee-machine/actions/makeDrink", $x);
$refresh();
)
```
